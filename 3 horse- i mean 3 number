#Write a program that asks the user for three integer numbers. The program prints out the sum, product, and average of the numbers.
a=float(input("enter the first number"))
b=float(input("enter the second number"))
c=float(input("enter the third number"))
sum=(a+b+c)
product=(a*b*c)
average=(sum/3)
print(f"your sum is {sum}")
print(f"your product is {product}")
print(f"your average is {average}")
